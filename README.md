# Hello there! :wave:

## About
I'm Karol, front-end dev wannabe from Warsaw. I've been coding since 2019 and trying to develop my skills as fast as possible. I'd like find my first commercial job and improve myself as a creative front-end developer with React.js.

Next goal is to get familiar with TypeScript and some UI/UX issues.
