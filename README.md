# Hello there! :wave:

## About
I'm Karol, frontend dev wannabe from Warsaw. I've been coding since 2019, gained my skills from online courses and stationary workshops. I'd like to find my first commercial job and grow as creative front-end developer.

In the near future, I plan to get familiar with TypeScript and UI/UX issues.
